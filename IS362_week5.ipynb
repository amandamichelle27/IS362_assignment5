    "We'll be using the `nlargest` method for each of these problems, as it fits our needs perfectly. In practical terms, this operation is similar to an `ORDER BY` with a `LIMIT` clause in SQL. Not only is it more convenient than sorting the entire data frame and taking the head, it's also more efficient as it only keeps to track of a single row at once and doesn't have to reorganize the entire table.\n",

However, this data has an error - Dillant Hopkins Airport has its latitude and longitude swapped and will incorrectly show up as the northernmost airport. The true answer is the second row, Wiley Post Will Rogers Memorial Airport. Plotting this on a map shows that is on the north coast of Alaska, so we can be reasonably sure that our methodology was correct."

Because longitude ranges from `-180°` in the west to `180°` in the east, finding the easternmost airport is equivalent to finding the one with the highest longitude, and so we can use `nlargest` again, this time sorting on `lon`. There is no error in the data that affects this problem, so we only need to display the single row, which shows that the easternmost airport is Eareckson Air Station. Funnily enough, this airport is also is Alaska, as Alaska happens to the northermost, westernmost, and easternmost state because it spans the International Date Line."
